/**
 * One board cell, one intended change, one idempotency key.
 *
 * The record layer's contract is explicit about what a key means: "generate a
 * UUID per intended action; retries reuse the SAME key (the pinned CARR
 * interface contract in `contracts/carr-interface.v1.json`).
 * A second call under the same key returns the STORED answer instead of writing
 * again, and a call whose arguments differ under a key that was already spent is
 * refused as `key_reuse`. Undo already honours that (change-receipts.mjs); the
 * board's cells did not, and minted a fresh key on every attempt.
 *
 * What that cost, exactly: a flag click commits event e1 and the answer is lost
 * on the way back. Nothing on the page moved, so the person clicks again before
 * the feed has delivered e1. The second click computes the same value from the
 * same still-stale base — but under a NEW key it is a new operation, so the
 * server sees an intervening event, records a durable conflict row, and the
 * board opens "Two edits crossed" with both sides attributed to the same person.
 * Under the ORIGINAL key the retry never reaches that handler: it replays.
 *
 * So this module holds, per `deal|field`, the one operation that has not been
 * answered yet, frozen:
 *
 *   - the request is built ONCE — deal, field, value, base_event_id, key — and
 *     every later attempt sends that same object. A base the changes feed has
 *     moved on since does not rewrite it: the request is a statement about what
 *     was on screen when the person acted, and replay depends on it byte for byte.
 *   - while a request is open, a second one for that cell is not sent at all.
 *     That is the double-click guard, and it is a guard against duplicate SENDS,
 *     not a guess about the outcome.
 *   - an unresolved operation is not silently replaced. A different intent for
 *     the same cell is refused with an explanation while the first one is still
 *     unknown, because minting a second key over the top of it is the defect,
 *     not the fix. Retrying the first one — same key — is offered instead.
 *   - only the server's own answer settles anything. There is no timer, no blind
 *     re-send, no optimistic value, and no second copy of the board: the entry is
 *     bookkeeping about one request, exactly as `state.undo` and `state.fieldBase`
 *     already are.
 *   - an accepted answer is reported as SUPERSEDED when this cell's base moved
 *     while the request was out AND the event that moved it is not this
 *     operation's own. A replay is truthful about an older operation, and a
 *     truthful old answer is still an old answer: if something else landed on
 *     that cell since, the caller is told to leave the newer state alone and
 *     re-read rather than paint the request's value over it. The answer names
 *     the event it committed, so this board's own write arriving on the feed is
 *     recognised as itself instead of being reported as a partner's change.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: infer that a write landed because the feed
 * later showed a matching value. A partner can set the same value; equality is
 * not evidence of authorship. An unresolved operation stays unresolved until the
 * server answers a re-send of it.

/**

 *                the base this request was built on, SOMETHING landed on that
 *                cell while the request was out.
 *   committedId  the event this very operation committed, named by the answer
 *                (`applyDealRoomField` reads its own row back). When the cell's
 *                newest event IS that event, the thing that moved the base was
 *                this operation's own write arriving on the feed — which is not
 *                a newer change to reconcile with, it is this change.
 *
 * Getting that second test wrong is a false sentence on the very path this
 * module exists for: a lost answer, retried, replays, the feed has meanwhile
 * delivered our own event, and the person would be told "the board has since
 * seen a newer change to this cell" about their own edit — while the value on
 * screen is exactly theirs, and the local apply is withheld for no reason.
 *
 * What it still does NOT claim: whose event a DIFFERENT newer id belongs to, or
 * what the cell now holds. An unrecognised newer event is treated as a partner's
