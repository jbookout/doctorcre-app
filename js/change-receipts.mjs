/**
 * Recent change receipts for the Deal Room board.
 *
 * Pure model: no DOM, no network, no storage, no timers. app.js feeds this the
 * events its existing change poll already returns and renders the strings this
 * module returns, so the panel adds no transport and no second read path.
 *
 * What this list is, exactly:
 *   - the newest RECEIPT_LIMIT changes THIS SESSION HAS SEEN on the feed. Not
 *     "changes made since you opened the page", and not a window over the
 *     event log: the tail of what was already recorded is in it too, once the
 *     cursor reaches the present (see createFeedProgress).
 *   - session memory only. It lives in the page; nothing is written to browser
 *     storage and no new persistence surface exists. A reload starts it empty.
 *   - the durable record is unchanged: every one of these changes stays in the
 *     deal's own Change history, which is where the full lineage lives.
 *   - Undo eligibility shown here is a HINT drawn from the events this session
 *     has seen. `revert-deal-field` on the server is the gate: it refuses
 *     anything that is no longer the latest change to that exact deal+field
 *     (including a partner's newer change), and that refusal stays visible on
 *     the row rather than being swallowed.
 *
 * Values are shown as the feed recorded them. Slug-shaped strings are
 * humanized in shape only (`due_diligence` -> "Due diligence"); no value is
 * remapped onto a different label, because the display vocabulary lives in
 * live-client.js and inventing a second copy here would let the two drift.
 */

/**
 * The fields `revert-deal-field` will act on. This is the client-side home for
 * that list — app.js imports it back rather than keeping its own copy — and it
 * mirrors the CARR `revert-deal-field` contract, which is the authority.
